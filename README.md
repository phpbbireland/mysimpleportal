MySimplePortal
--------------

A simple portal to provide a web presence without requiring any coding skills.   
The back-end is a combination of code from phpBB3 and code from Kiss.  
This is used for general control but there's no forum and no database.

* You can have as many pages are you wish...
* All pages are editable by clicking the "Edit Icon" on that page...
* It can use commonly available widgets and you can create and add dynamic blocks...
* To get up and running takes about 60 seconds...
* Learning curve... only takes a few minutes to master...
* In a nut shell, it allows anyone to have a web presence and edit it in real time without with little or no php, mysql or even html skills

**Edits methods:**

You can either the page manually by clicking on the "Edit icon" or using a wysiwyg edit to create a page and then paste the code into the page... I am probably going to add one of the opensource wysiwyg editors to provide much more control and make it easier to create and edit pages...
