MySimplePortal
--------------
**Security Update**
Plese update all jquery code to > 3.5.0

A simple portal to provide a web presence without requiring any coding skills.   
The back-end is a combination of code from phpBB3 and the Kiss Portal Engine.  
This is used for general control but there's no forum and no database.

* You can have as many pages are you wish...
* All pages are editable by clicking the "Edit Icon" on that page...
* It can use commonly available widgets and you can create and add dynamic blocks...
* To get up and running takes about 60 seconds...
* No actual learning curve, only takes a few minutes to master...

In a nut shell, **MySimplePortal** allows anyone to have a web presence and gives them the ability to edit their pages (in real time) with little or no php, mysql or even html skills  

The development team will provide additional features and user requested features based on popularity and taking into account the current work load.

**Editing pages:**  
You can edit the page manually by clicking on the "Edit icon" or using a WYSIWYG edit to create a page and then paste the code into the edit window... I am probably going to add one of the open source WYSIWYG editors to provide much more control and make it easier to create and edit pages...

Once we have determined the rest of the structure we will start on the SimpleBlog...
